This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# How to Use Webpage
1. Depending on your device:
- For Windows: Use the Snipping tool to take a snippet of the text message you want to analyze and save it.
- For Mac: Press and hold these three keys together: Shift, Command, and 3 to take a screenshot of the text message and save it.
2. Click on the "select file" button and select your text message.
3. Click on "get pirate's opinion" to analyze your text message.
4. Profit! Now you know the chance your text message is a scam and you can act accordingly!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
